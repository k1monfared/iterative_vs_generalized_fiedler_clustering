Read the pdf file `iterative_vs_generalized_fiedler.pdf` for explanations.

The main scripts to produce the data are 
1)  `compare_heirarchical_fiedler_generalized_feidler_faraway.m`, and 
2)  `compare_heirarchical_fiedler_generalized_feidler_comparable.m`.
The first one generates data for graphs with clusters of sizes that are very different from each other, and the second one generates data for graphs whose clusters have relatively similar sizes.

The scripts to produce plots are 
1) `plot_farawy_sizes_restuls.m`, and 
2) `plot_comparable_sizes_restuls`.
